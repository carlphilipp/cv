\section{Personal Synopsis}
Currently working as a software consultant, I am looking for a new challenge. I am passionate about building awesome software, and IT in general. I really like being part of a team and I think communication is very important. My preferred programming language is Java, I use it everyday at work and in my personal projects. At the moment, I am very interested in Android and Node.js, but I am open to anything. I obtained the OCJP certification two years ago in addition to my Master's degree in computer science. I am a very motivated and curious person.

\section{Professional Experience}
\cventry{2012-2013\\ \scriptsize{Feb. to Now}}
		{Software Consultant}
		{Cameleon Software}{Chicago}
		{United States}
		{As a consultant, I work for different customers and for several projects that use Cameleon technology: Java, web services, Oracle database, SalesForce.com, JBoss etc. I dealt wih the functional and the technical part of the projects.}{}

\cventry{2011\\ \scriptsize{Apr. to July}}
		{Java EE developer}
		{Fujitsu Technology Solutions}
		{Luxembourg}
		{Luxembourg}
		{In a Java EE context, I made a solution to improve the way to use Arquillian. Arquillian is a tool, made by JBoss, which allows developers to test the components of their application in a container. I made improvements to the test process by the creation of a Maven plugin which generates an Arquillian test class; and automatic search of dependencies needed for the archive deployed on the server. I had to utilise Maven, JUnit, EJBs, Cobertura, and many other tools and frameworks.}{}
				
\cventry{2010\\ \scriptsize{June to July}}
		{Analyst programmer}
		{Sailendra}
		{Nancy}
		{France}
		{During a project run by Sailendra for a pharmaceutical company, I was partnered with the project
manager. I had to work with the client to ascertain and identify their specific requirements.
Consequently, I had to learn Zope/Plone and then create a component (DTML and Python).}{}

\cventry{2010\\ \scriptsize{Jan. to March}}
		{Analyst programmer}
		{Sailendra}
		{Nancy}
		{France}
		{Sailendra created a technology of user profiling. That technology creates a profile of each user and predicts their comportments based on their actions and artificial intelligence algorithms.
My task was to create a Firefox plugin for their technology. I managed the project from initiation to implementation overseeing the planning, functional specifications, technical specifications, development of the plugin, development of the server, utilisation of Sailendra’s libraries, and testing. I had to learn new technologies and frameworks, for example, XUL and Spring (JEE). I was given complete autonomy for the project.}
