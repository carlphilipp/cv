# Carl-Philipp Harmant's CV

Forked cv from [afriggeri](https://github.com/martinbjeldbak/afriggeri-cv) and cherry pick social icons from [martinbjeldbak](https://github.com/martinbjeldbak/CV).
My changes includes:
* Wider main layout
* Update default blue color
* Modify default list to add one more field
* Reduce space for bullet lists
* Remove bibligraphy
* Modified default link color
* Include fonts

Need to use XeLateX to compile/build the CV.


Original read me file:

# About
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `ugly` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on cheap paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue, biblatex to print my publications and textpos for the aside.
